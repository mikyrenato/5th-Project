**Live Application:** [House Price Predictor](https://house-price-predictor-pp5.herokuapp.com/)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle is an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts that offers collaboration, dataset publishing, GPU integrated notebooks, and data science challenges.

For this project, a fictional user story has been created. However, the predictive analytics techniques applied can be utilized in real-world projects, such as those related to the housing market in Ames.

The dataset, found on Kaggle under the Code Institute account, consists of 1,460 rows (including variable names) representing housing records from Ames, Iowa, USA. It includes various house profiles, such as floor areas, basements, garages, kitchens, lots, porches, wood decks, and the year built, among others. The dataset covers houses built between 1872 and 2010, along with their respective sale prices.

To help you understand the analysis performed in the project, refer to the table below, which provides explanations and units for each variable used:

## CRISP-DM: A Comprehensive Data Science Process

![CRISP-DM](/static/images/CRISP-DM.png)

CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is a well-known process model that serves as the foundation for data science projects.

The CRISP-DM model consists of six sequential phases:

1. Business Understanding: Understand the objectives and requirements of the business.
2. Data Understanding: Gain insights into the available data and assess its quality and relevance.
   - Remember, "garbage in, garbage out" - it's crucial to ensure data cleanliness.
3. Data Preparation: Organize and preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling.
4. Modeling: Apply appropriate modeling techniques to extract insights and patterns from the data.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of different models and select the one that best meets the business's objectives.
6. Deployment: Deploy the chosen model and make it accessible to relevant stakeholders.

If you would like to explore each of the above phases in more detail and learn how to effectively utilize them, please refer to the [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) resource.

## Business Requirements.


I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Developer course offered by Code Institute. Throughout the course, I have gained knowledge and practical experience in various areas, including Machine Learning. This valuable skillset will greatly benefit me in my future career as a Data Scientist.

Recently, a customer of mine, who resides in the United States, embarked on a venture in the real estate industry. Her vision entails purchasing six houses located in Ames, a small town in Iowa. With its strong and stable economy, coupled with a vibrant cultural environment and a population of over 89,540 residents, my customer firmly believes that investing in this area will yield significant returns. Her plan involves acquiring older properties, renovating them, and subsequently selling them at higher prices.

Although my customer possesses a solid understanding of the average house prices in this region, she recognizes the importance of accurate predictions to ensure the success of her investment. Consequently, she approached me, her uncle, knowing that I possess expertise in machine learning. By leveraging the power of this technology, I can provide her with precise price predictions for each of the refurbished houses, eliminating the risk of unreliable appraisals.

To facilitate this task, my customer has conducted extensive research and identified a publicly available dataset containing historical records of sold houses. She will share this dataset with me, enabling me to create a robust prediction model that aligns with her business goals.

## Hypothesis and Validation


1. Hypothesis One:
   - Assumption: The price of houses is positively correlated with their surface area measured in square feet.
   - Validation Approach: Perform a correlation study to examine the relationship between house prices and surface area.

2. Hypothesis Two:
   - Assumption: Houses with the same usable surface area but built more recently have a higher price than older-built homes.
   - Validation Approach: Conduct a correlation study to investigate the relationship between house prices and the year they were built.

3. Hypothesis Three:
   - Assumption: Houses with the same usable surface area, built in a recent year, but remodeled recently, have a higher price compared to houses built in the same year but not remodeled.
   - Validation Approach: Perform a correlation study to analyze the relationship between house prices and remodeling status.

4. Hypothesis Four:
   - Assumption: Houses with similar surface area but higher quality materials and condition scores tend to have a higher sales price.
   - Validation Approach: Conduct a correlation study to assess the relationship between house prices and material/condition scores.

## Rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks

List the business requirements and rationale to map them to the data visualizations and ML tasks.

---

### Business Requirement 1 â€“ Data Visualization and Correlation Study

- As a data analyst, I need to visualize the data related to the house records to understand how each attribute influences the sale price.
- Conduct a correlation study (Pearson and Spearman) to determine the correlation between variables and the sale price.
	- Perform correlation and/or PPS studies to investigate the most relevant variables correlated to the sale price.
- Plot the main variables against the sale price to visualize insights on how the house attributes correlate with the sale price.
- Summarize the insights obtained from visualizing these variables against the sale price.

## Outcome after predicting pricing

After conducting our study, we realized that the features that impact the price are:

![Features Impacting Price](/static/images/importancefeat.png)

We can take a closer look at each:

- GrLivArea (Above grade (ground) living area square feet)
  ![GrLivArea](/static/images/GrLivArea.png)

- GarageArea (Size of garage in square feet)

  ![OverallQual](/static/images/OverallQual.png)

- TotalBsmtSF (Total square feet of basement area)
  ![TotalBsmtSF](/static/images/TotalBsmtSF.png)

For more details, please refer to the live app linked at the top of the readme/deployment.

### Business Requirement 2

- As a data analyst, I need to predict the sale price of the houses.
- Build an ML model to predict the house prices for the 6 newly refurbished houses my niece plans to sell.
- Ensure that the ML system can reliably predict the summed sale price of the 6 houses.
- Use either conventional ML or Neural Networks to establish the relationships between the features and the target variable.
- Consider changing the ML task from regression to classification if a valid rationale exists.
- If using conventional ML with libraries like scikit-learn, perform extensive hyperparameter optimization for the chosen algorithm.



## Outcome after price prediction.

- My client wanted to find out what are the prices for the houses. 

![6predictions](/static/images/nieceprediction.png)

- In the feature she could use the added tool to be able to predict pricing for houses by imputing her own inputs.This can be located on the deployed site.

## Unfixed Bugs

- After conducting several tests, no bugs were found in the project.
- However, there are some warnings related to updates in the pandas package, which may cause certain variables to not work as expected. These warnings arose because the template provided by Code Institute did not include an updated version of the pandas package. Although the project was checked before submission on February 2nd and works as expected, I will make sure to update these packages to fully optimize the project's performance.

## Python Code Testing

- The python code was tested using "python3 -m flake8 app_pages" in the GitPod terminal.
- The flake8 tool was used, as the pep8 page was deactivated. The code passed the flake8 test, except for the "f-string is missing placeholders" warning.
- Since the code works as expected, I chose to ignore these warnings.
