        f"### Project Hypothesis and Validation\n\n"
        f"I have found 4 hypothesis and their validation:\n\n"
        f"**1. Hypothesis one.** \n"
        f"* We consider the price of houses to be higher if the house has had "
        f"a larger surface measured in sq. ft. \n"
        f"* A correlation study can help in investigating if this is true.\n\n"
        f"**2. Hypothesis Two.** \n"
        f"* We consider that a houses with the same util surface measured "
        f"in sq. ft., but built more recently has had a higher price then a "
        f"older built house. \n"
        f"* A correlation study can help in investigating if this is true.\n\n"
        f"**3. Hypothesis Three.** \n"
        f"* We consider the houses with the same util surface measured in "
        f"sq. ft "
        f"built in a recent year, but remodeled recently has had a higher "
        f"price "
        f"then a house built in the same year, but not recently refurbished.\n"
        f"* A correlation study can help in investigating if this is true.\n\n"
        f"**4. Hypothesis Four.** \n"
        f"* We consider that a house with similar sq. ft., but with a higher "
        f"quality of materials and condition scores might have had a "
        f"higher sale price.\n"
        f"* A correlation study can help in investigating if this is true."
